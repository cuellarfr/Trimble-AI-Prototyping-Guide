# AI Prototyping for Designers
**Trimble's practical guide to building real things with Cursor for designers**

---

## Prerequisites — Before you start

This section isn't part of the learning curve. It's just logistics. Get these sorted before you dive into the guide and you won't hit any surprise blockers later.

### Step 1: Request company access

Some of these tools require a paid seat or company account. Before doing anything else, reach out to Monica and ask for access to:

- **Claude** (claude.ai) — Anthropic's AI assistant, used throughout this guide
- **Claude Code** — Anthropic's AI coding tool that runs in Terminal
- **Cursor** — AI-powered code editor
- **Vercel** — deployment platform for sharing your prototypes

Ping Monica in Slack and she'll get you sorted. Don't skip this step — you'll need it before Day 1.

---

### Step 2: Create a GitHub account

**What GitHub is and why you need it**

GitHub is where code lives. Think of it the way you think of Figma for design files — it's a shared home for your projects, with version history built in.

When you build a prototype, your code lives in a **repository** (or "repo") — a folder that GitHub tracks. Every time you save a meaningful change, you create a **commit** — a snapshot of your project at that moment. This means you can always go back to an earlier version if something breaks. You can also share a repo with a teammate, and they can pick up where you left off.

You need GitHub for two reasons in this workflow. First, it's where your prototype code is stored, safe and versioned. Second, Vercel (the tool that gives your prototype a real URL) connects directly to GitHub — whenever you push code to GitHub, Vercel automatically redeploys your prototype. That's the deployment pipeline: GitHub stores your code, Vercel publishes it.

You don't need to deeply understand GitHub to use it in this workflow. There are really only three actions you'll use regularly:

- **Clone** — download a repo to your computer so you can work on it
- **Commit** — save a snapshot of your changes with a short description
- **Push** — send your local changes up to GitHub

Claude Code and Cursor can both do all three of these for you through conversation. You won't need to memorize commands.

**Create your account:**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and create an account with your Savvy email
3. Choose the free plan — it's all you need for prototyping
4. Verify your email

---

### Step 3: Create a Vercel account

**What Vercel is and why you need it**

Right now, your prototypes only exist on your laptop. When you run `npm run dev`, you're visiting `localhost:3000` — a website that only lives on your machine. No one else can see it.

Vercel solves that. It takes your code from GitHub and publishes it to the internet, giving you a real URL like `my-prototype.vercel.app` that you can share with anyone — a stakeholder in a meeting, a PM on Slack, a user you're testing with. No installation, no special access required on their end. Just a link.

The deployment process is almost invisible once it's set up. You push code to GitHub, Vercel detects the change, rebuilds your app, and updates the live URL — usually in under a minute. This is called **continuous deployment**, and it means your shareable prototype always reflects your latest work.

Vercel is free for personal projects and prototyping. You won't need a paid plan for anything in this guide.

**Create your account:**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" and choose **Continue with GitHub** — this links your accounts automatically
3. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub repositories
4. You're in. No project setup needed yet — you'll do that in Day 5.

---

### Step 4: Create a Cursor account

**What Cursor is** (you'll learn more in section 6, but you need the account now)

Cursor is a code editor — the app you'll use to read and write code — with AI built directly into it. It's where a lot of the hands-on prototype work happens.

**Install and create your account:**
1. Go to [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Download and install the Mac app
3. Open Cursor and sign up for an account (the Hobby plan is free and sufficient to start)
4. You'll be asked to connect your AI — you can skip this for now, you'll configure it in section 6

---

### Your prerequisites checklist

Before moving on, confirm you have all of these:

- [ ] Received company access to Claude, Claude Code, Cursor, and Vercel from Monica
- [ ] GitHub account created at github.com with your Savvy email
- [ ] Vercel account created at vercel.com, connected to GitHub
- [ ] Cursor downloaded, installed, and account created

Once these are checked off, you're ready. Start with section 1.

## 1. Why we're going deeper than Figma

Figma is still home base. This isn't about replacing it.

But Figma prototypes have a ceiling. They can't show real data loading in from an API. They can't demonstrate what happens when a client has 47 accounts, or how a table behaves when a column is empty, or what a form actually feels like to tab through. And every time we hand a clickable prototype to an engineer, something gets lost in translation.

AI-assisted code prototypes close that gap. With Claude Code or Cursor, you can go from idea to a working, shareable URL in under an hour — no engineering sprint required. The output isn't production code, but it's real enough to test, share with stakeholders, and hand off with confidence.

There's a learning curve. We're not going to pretend otherwise. But you don't need to become an engineer. You need to get comfortable with a few new tools and a new mental model — and that's exactly what this guide is for.

---

## 2. Mental models before we start

Two concepts will make everything else in this guide click.

### Web app vs. desktop app

A **desktop app** is software installed on your computer — like Figma, Slack, or Spotify. It lives in your Applications folder.

A **web app** is software that runs in a browser — like Gmail, Notion, or the Savvy client dashboard. It lives at a URL.

When we build prototypes, we're building web apps. That means the output is a URL you can share with anyone, on any device, with no installation required. It also means the code runs in a browser, which shapes everything about how we build it.

### What "running locally" means

When you run a prototype on your own computer, you're spinning up a tiny pretend server. Your browser visits that server at a special address: `localhost:3000` (or similar). It looks and behaves like a real website — but it only exists on your machine.

This is called a **local development environment**. It sounds intimidating, but the mental model is simple: you're running a mini website on your laptop. When you're done, you stop the server and it goes away. Nothing is published to the internet.

When you're ready to share with someone else, you can deploy it to a real URL (Vercel makes this one command). But for prototyping, local is fine.

---

## 3. Getting comfortable with Terminal

Terminal is just a text-based way to talk to your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands. That's it.

Most designers feel a flash of anxiety the first time they open it. The black screen, the blinking cursor, the lack of any visual affordance for what to do next. This is normal. It passes quickly once you know the six commands you'll actually use.

### Open Terminal
On Mac: `Cmd + Space` → type "Terminal" → Enter

### The 6 commands you need

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `pwd` | "Where am I?" Shows your current folder | `pwd` |
| `ls` | Lists everything in the current folder | `ls` |
| `cd` | Navigate into a folder | `cd Desktop` |
| `cd ..` | Go up one level | `cd ..` |
| `npm install` | Installs a project's dependencies | `npm install` |
| `npm run dev` | Starts your local development server | `npm run dev` |

**To stop a running server:** `Ctrl + C`

### How to read an error message

Errors look alarming. They're usually not. When something goes wrong in Terminal, read the last 2–3 lines first — that's almost always where the actual problem is described. Copy the error, paste it into Claude or Google. Engineers do this constantly.

---

## 4. Setting up your environment

Do this once. You won't have to do it again.

### Step 1: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for Mac — think of it as an app store you control from Terminal. It's the most reliable way to install developer tools like Node.js, and once it's set up, future installs are a single command.

In Terminal, paste this and hit Enter:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will take 2–3 minutes. It may ask for your Mac password — type it and hit Enter (you won't see the characters as you type, that's normal). Wait for it to finish before doing anything else.

When it's done, verify it worked:

```
brew --version
```

You should see something like `Homebrew 4.2.0`. If you do, you're good.

### Step 2: Install Node.js via Homebrew

Node.js is what lets your computer run JavaScript outside of a browser. You need it to run React projects locally.

```
brew install node
```

This takes about a minute. When it's done, verify:

```
node --version
```

You should see something like `v20.11.0`. If you see a version number, you're good.

### Step 3: Install Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI coding tool that runs directly in Terminal. It can read your files, write code, run commands, and iterate — all through a conversation interface.

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Once installed, navigate to a project folder and run:

```
claude
```

You'll be prompted to log in with your Anthropic account. After that, you're in.

### Step 4: Or install Cursor

Cursor is a code editor (like VS Code) with AI built in. It gives you a visual interface alongside the AI — you can see your files, preview changes, and chat with the AI in a sidebar panel.

Download from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com). Install like any Mac app. Open a project folder by dragging it onto the Cursor icon.

**Cursor vs. Claude Code: which should you use?**

Use **Claude Code** when you want to move fast and stay in Terminal — great for generating a full prototype from scratch.

Use **Cursor** when you want more visual control, want to see and navigate your files, or are making targeted edits to an existing prototype.

You'll probably end up using both.

### Step 5: Create your first project

First, let's create a dedicated folder to keep all your projects organized. In Terminal, run:

```
mkdir projects
```

Then verify it worked by running:

```
ls
```

You should see `projects` listed in the output. Now navigate into it and create your React app:

```
cd projects
npx create-react-app my-prototype
cd my-prototype
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `localhost:3000`. You should see the default React welcome page. You now have a working local development environment.

---

## 5. Building your first prototype with Claude Code

Let's build something real. We'll use a Savvy-flavored example: a client portfolio summary card.

### Starting a session

Navigate to your project folder in Terminal, then run:

```
claude
```

Claude Code will read your project files and be ready to help.

### How to prompt effectively

Claude Code works best when you give it context upfront. Don't just say what you want — tell it who you're building for, what the interface should feel like, and any constraints.

**Weak prompt:**
> Make a portfolio card component.

**Strong prompt:**
> I'm building a prototype for a wealth management platform. I need a client portfolio summary card component in React. It should show: client name, total portfolio value, YTD performance (positive/negative with color), and a list of 3 top holdings with ticker symbols and allocation percentages. Use a clean, minimal design with a white background, neutral typography, and a subtle border. No external UI libraries — just CSS modules or inline styles.

The more context you give, the closer the first output will be to what you want.

### Iterating through conversation

Once Claude Code generates something, keep the conversation going:

- *"The typography feels too large — scale everything down and add more breathing room between sections."*
- *"The negative performance should use a muted red, not a bright red. Something like #C0392B at 80% opacity."*
- *"Add a sparkline chart using only CSS — no chart libraries."*

You don't need to understand the code it writes. You need to be able to describe what's wrong and what you want instead — which is exactly what designers are already good at.

### Saving your work

Claude Code edits files directly. Your changes are saved automatically. To see updates in the browser, your dev server needs to be running (`npm run dev` in a separate Terminal window). React will hot-reload — the browser updates automatically when files change.

---

## 6. Cursor as your IDE

If Terminal-only feels like too much at first, Cursor gives you a visual layer on top.

### Opening a project

Open Cursor, then drag your project folder onto the app icon (or use File → Open Folder). You'll see your file tree on the left, just like Finder.

### The Composer panel

This is your main interface with the AI. Open it with `Cmd + I`. Type your request in natural language — Cursor will propose changes to your files, which you can review and accept or reject before they're applied.

This review step is Cursor's biggest advantage over Claude Code in Terminal: you can see exactly what's changing before it happens.

### Useful Cursor habits

- **Highlight code before prompting** — select a specific component or function, then open Composer. The AI will focus on just that selection.
- **Use `@filename`** — reference specific files in your prompt so Cursor knows what you're talking about.
- **Check the diff** — before accepting a change, scroll through the red/green diff view. You'll start to recognize patterns in the code even without fully understanding it.

---

## 7. Connecting Claude Code to Figma

This is where things get genuinely exciting. By connecting Claude Code to Figma, you get true bidirectional prototyping — Claude can read your Figma designs and generate code from them, and you can send working prototypes back to Figma as editable layers. 

You need to complete two authentications to make this work: an API key (so Claude can read your Figma files) and OAuth (so Claude can write back to Figma). Both are required. Do them in this order.

### Why you need both

**API key** → gives Claude read access to your Figma files. This is how Claude understands your designs, layers, colors, and components when generating code.

**OAuth** → authorizes Claude to write back to Figma. This is what powers "Send this to Figma" — pushing a working prototype back as editable Figma layers.

Skip either one and bidirectional prototyping won't work.

---

### Step 1: Generate your Figma API token

In Figma: click your profile icon → Settings → Security → Personal access tokens → Generate new token.

When it asks about permissions, **turn on all read and write access**. This is important — a read-only token will let Claude pull in your designs but won't let it send anything back.

Copy the token and save it somewhere safe like 1Password. You won't be able to see it again after closing the modal.

---

### Step 2: Store the token in your shell

This is the step most people get stuck on. You're going to store your token as an environment variable so Claude Code can access it automatically every time it runs.

In Terminal, open your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

This opens a basic text editor inside Terminal. Use the arrow keys to scroll all the way to the **bottom** of the file. On a completely new line, paste exactly this:

```bash
export FIGMA_API_KEY="your-token-here"
```

Replace `your-token-here` with the token you copied from Figma. Keep the quotes.

Save and exit:
- `Ctrl + O` to save
- `Enter` to confirm
- `Ctrl + X` to exit

Now apply the change without restarting Terminal:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify it worked:

```bash
echo $FIGMA_API_KEY
```

You should see your token printed back. If you see nothing, the save didn't work — try again, making sure you're pasting on a new line at the very bottom of the file.

> **Important:** if you accidentally paste your token directly into Terminal as a command (instead of inside nano), Figma will detect it as an exposed key and automatically invalidate it. If that happened, go back to Figma and generate a fresh token before continuing.

---

### Step 3: Add the Figma MCP server

Now tell Claude Code where to find Figma. Run this in Terminal:

```bash
# For the current project only
claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp

# Or to make it available across all your projects
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
```

We recommend the `--scope user` version so you only have to do this once.

---

### Step 4: Restart Claude Code and authenticate via OAuth

Fully quit Claude Code and relaunch it. This is required — the MCP connection initializes at startup, so adding a new server mid-session won't take effect until you restart.

Once relaunched, type:

```
/mcp
```

You'll see the Figma server listed. Select it, choose **Authenticate**, and complete the OAuth flow in your browser. When you see:

```
✓ Authentication successful. Connected to figma
```

You're connected. This OAuth step is what authorizes the write direction — sending things back to Figma.

---

### Step 5: Verify the connection

Run `/mcp` again. The Figma server should show a green connected status. If it doesn't, restart Claude Code once more and retry.

---

### Step 6: Send your prototype to Figma

Build something in Claude Code, preview it in your browser, then type in Claude Code:

```
Send this to Figma
```

A capture toolbar will appear in your browser. You can capture the entire screen or select specific elements. The captured UI appears as editable frames in your Figma workspace — you can then paste them into any existing project, refine them in Figma, and continue iterating.

---

### A full bidirectional workflow

1. Design a component in Figma with auto-layout and named layers
2. In Claude Code: *"Build a React component from this Figma frame — [paste frame link]"*
3. Claude reads the design and generates code. Run `npm start` to see it in the browser.
4. Iterate in Claude Code: *"The padding feels tight — add 8px on all sides and soften the border radius"*
5. When happy: type "Send this to Figma" — your working prototype lands back in Figma as editable layers
6. Deploy to Vercel with `npx vercel` and share the URL

Start to shareable prototype, with a round-trip to Figma: under an hour.

---

### Troubleshooting

**The Figma server doesn't appear after adding it** — restart Claude Code completely. The MCP connection only initializes at startup.

**Authentication successful but nothing sends to Figma** — check that your API token has write permissions. Go back to Figma settings and confirm all read/write access is enabled on the token.

**Token was invalidated** — this happens when a token is accidentally pasted as a Terminal command instead of stored in `.zshrc`. Generate a new one in Figma and start from Step 2.

---

## 8. Prompting patterns for designers

Copy, adapt, and make these your own.

### Generate a component from scratch
> I'm building a [type of interface] for [audience]. Create a React component for [specific element]. It should [describe behavior/content]. Design it to feel [aesthetic direction — clean/minimal/dense/etc.]. Use [white background / our brand colors / etc.]. No external libraries.

### Match an existing design system
> Here's the color palette and typography we use: [paste your tokens or describe them]. Generate a [component] that matches this system exactly. Use these exact hex values and font sizes.

### Add interactivity
> The component currently shows a static list. Add the ability to click any row to expand it and show [additional content]. Use a smooth CSS transition for the expand/collapse.

### Debug something that's broken
> This component isn't rendering correctly — [describe what's wrong]. Here's the current code: [paste code]. What's wrong and how do I fix it?

### Translate a Figma description to code
> I have a Figma component with the following properties: [describe layers, spacing, colors]. Build a React component that matches this structure. Use CSS modules.

---

## 9. When things break

Things will break. This is normal. Here's how to handle it.

### "Port 3000 is already in use"
Another dev server is running somewhere. Either stop it (`Ctrl + C` in the Terminal window running it) or run your new project on a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`

### "Module not found" or "Cannot find package"
A dependency isn't installed. Run `npm install` in your project folder and try again.

### Claude generated code that won't compile
Copy the error from Terminal and paste it directly into your Claude Code session: *"I'm getting this error — [paste error]. How do I fix it?"* Claude will usually solve it immediately.

### The Figma MCP isn't connecting
Double-check your `.mcp.json` file — the token needs to be pasted exactly, no extra spaces. Make sure you've restarted Claude Code after creating the file.

### The output looks nothing like my Figma design
Your Figma file may not be structured clearly enough for Claude to read. Check that you're using auto-layout, that layers are named descriptively, and that you're linking to a specific frame (not a whole page). Try adding more context in your prompt about the design intent.

### I have no idea what I'm looking at in the code
That's fine. You don't need to understand every line. Describe what you want to change in plain English and let Claude handle the code. Over time, you'll start to recognize patterns — but that's a side effect, not a prerequisite.

---

## 10. Your first week

Low pressure. Concrete steps.

**Day 1 — Environment, first component, and Figma connection (all in one hour)**
Get your environment running, build something real, and connect to Figma — all in a single focused session. Install Node.js, get Claude Code or Cursor running, create a React project, and see `localhost:3000` in your browser. Then ask Claude Code to build one component from scratch using a real Savvy use case — a data table, a summary card, a form. Finally, set up the Figma MCP connection and do one round-trip: take a frame from a current project, generate a component from it, and send something back. Don't aim for perfection. Just get the full loop working.

**Day 2 — Build**
Take whatever you built on Day 1 and spend 30 minutes improving it through conversation. Practice describing visual changes in words — spacing, hierarchy, color, interaction. This is the core skill. The more precisely you can describe what you want, the faster Claude moves.

**Day 3 — Deploy**
Deploy your prototype to Vercel (`npx vercel` — it'll walk you through setup) and share the URL in #team-design. You built a real, shareable web app. That's worth celebrating.

---

## 11. Using AI tools efficiently — credits and model selection

AI coding tools aren't free to run. Every prompt you send uses credits, and the more powerful the model, the more credits it costs. Learning to use the right model for the right job — and to structure your prompts efficiently — will make your credits go a lot further.

### Understanding the model tiers

Both Claude and Cursor give you access to different models at different capability (and cost) levels. Think of them like tools in a toolbox — you wouldn't use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame.

**Opus** is the most powerful and the most expensive. It's built for hard thinking — complex architecture decisions, understanding an unfamiliar codebase, debugging a gnarly problem you can't figure out, or generating a large feature from scratch with a lot of moving parts. Use it when you're stuck or when the task genuinely requires reasoning through something complicated. Don't burn Opus on simple tasks.

**Sonnet** is the sweet spot for most prototyping work. Fast, capable, and significantly cheaper than Opus. Use it for building components, iterating on layouts, making a series of targeted changes, or any task where you have a clear idea of what you want and just need it executed well.

**Haiku** (or equivalent lightweight models) is best for simple, mechanical tasks — updating a hex color value, changing a text string, reformatting a file, fixing a typo in code. If the task requires almost no judgment, use the cheapest model available.

**A simple rule of thumb:** if you could explain the task to a junior engineer in one sentence and they'd get it right, use a fast model. If you'd need to sit down and walk through it together, use Opus.

### How to switch models in Cursor

In the Composer panel, there's a model selector dropdown at the bottom of the input field. Click it to switch between Claude Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku before sending your prompt. Get in the habit of glancing at this before you hit Enter — it takes two seconds and can save a lot of credits over a week.

### How to switch models in Claude Code

In a Claude Code session, you can specify the model with a flag when you start:

```
claude --model claude-opus-4-5
claude --model claude-sonnet-4-5
claude --model claude-haiku-4-5
```

Or switch mid-session by typing `/model` and selecting from the list.

### Structuring prompts to use fewer credits

**Go big upfront.** The most expensive thing you can do is send five small prompts to do what one thorough prompt could have accomplished. Before you start a session, write out everything you want — all the changes, all the constraints, all the context — and send it as one prompt. Cursor and Claude Code both perform better with more context anyway.

**Tell it not to ask questions.** By default, AI tools will sometimes pause and check in. Add "don't ask clarifying questions, make reasonable decisions" to any big prompt and it'll complete the whole task in one pass.

**Highlight before prompting in Cursor.** Select only the code you want to change before opening Composer. If you don't highlight anything, Cursor scans your entire project for context — which costs more and can introduce noise. Scoping your selection keeps the AI focused and your credit usage low.

**Batch small changes.** Instead of sending three separate prompts to update a font size, change a border color, and adjust padding, combine them into one: "Make these three changes to the sidebar component — [list them]." Three prompts versus one is a 3x credit difference for the same outcome.

**Use Tab autocomplete for tiny edits.** In Cursor, if you're making a small code change — tweaking a number, updating a string — just start typing and let Tab autocomplete finish the line. This is free and instant. Reserve AI prompts for things that actually need reasoning.

**Don't re-explain context.** Claude Code maintains context within a session. If you've already told it what you're building and what the design system looks like, you don't need to repeat it every prompt. Just describe the change you want. Starting a new session does reset the context, so try to batch related work into a single session when you can.

### A practical credit budget mindset

Think of each session like a working meeting. Open it with a clear agenda (your big upfront prompt), use the right tool for each agenda item (model selection), and don't schedule five meetings to do what one could accomplish (batching). Close the session when you're done rather than leaving it idle.

Over time you'll develop an intuition for when something warrants Opus versus when Sonnet will nail it. When in doubt, start with Sonnet — you can always escalate to Opus if the output isn't quite right.
